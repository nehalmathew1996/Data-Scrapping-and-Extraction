      "Frequenting The Leela has become a regular affair. However - there is nothing regular about this hotel, it's staff or it's care about the guests.  The moment you pass through those cast iron gates and enter into the the opulent yet calming surroundings, you are transported to a different era. A more graceful place, where we are courteous and graceful to each other. Where luxury is present yet never overwhelming. Where staff doesn't treat you like a temporary visitor but like a friend or family member - and doing so genuinely. The smiles, the small talk and the warmth exuded by everyone simply makes this palace property unique.

We mom and daughter are pool freaks and it's been more than a year we have not had access to a pool.

Our first dinner was at the Zen restaurant for his birthday, the food was really nice and the service was great, so we decided to come back and spend an evening at this breath taking property.  From the guard at the entrance to the front office staff, room service, everyone was so hospitable and warm.   From the safety aspect, the hotel has taken every measure for the safety of their guests and most importantly their staff.   I always say, it’s just another hotel and what sets it apart is the people, and at the Leela you can count on just that.  Great staff, Great service and Great value for money.   Thank you again Leela team and will be back again \n",

We really wished we could have stayed there for some more days. If we are coming again to Bangalore, we will surely stay in Leela Palace. On our way home, we had to stay in some other 5 star hotel in Salem( Iam not saying its name). We really felt the difference. There the staff approach was horrible.

      "We booked The Leela for New Year's eve. Knowing very well that it's going to be the busiest time for any hotel, we took a chance. But the service and upkeep of Leela was amazing.  The check in process was a breeze even though the place was flooded with guests. It must have taken hardly 2 minutes for the check in. The room was impressive at over 500sq ft. They did consider our request to provide a pool facing room as well. All in all, really good room.   In terms of service, the room service was quick. The breakfast buffet was crowded but they still managed to serve at a reasonable pace. The spread was pretty good.  All in all, a very good experience. Will definitely visit again. \n",

Team was in a hurry and they are much bothered about time and not even allowed us to have our food peacefully. All they want is to close thier kitchen ontime. 2-3 members of the team has approached us saying it was the closing time and we need to give a final order. We would have been more happier if they would not have allowed us inside instead of bothering us in that way. Next day we went for breakfast buffet and surprisingly none of the team has come to our table to let us know the list of items available at live counter and we started searching by ourselves.

We stayed in the royal club room, the room had all the amenenities you can expect from Leela. But the TV was a huge let down, it was some old aged LCD tv at least 10-15 years old.  The room came with High Tea and Cocktail hours. Food during these were subpar not at 5 star quality at all. The service was worse. A la-carte were given   Abhishek from frontdesk tried best to cover up for the poor experience. Gave late checkout and personalized checkin services \n",

The grandiosity and sheer opulence of this leela property is a class apart from the many other hotels visited prior by me . A big thank you to Mr Abhishek for the upgrade to Turret suite .A swanky new BMW 5 series awaited our arrival at the banglore airport with the Leela staff assisting me right from the baggage claim . Manuvering through the streets of banglore my trip from airport to the property was a wonderful experience . Once at the property the chauffeur greeted me with ' Welcome to Leela Palace Banglore' and i entered a different world .

They provided us a crib in the room which I felt was a really good gesture. But  in the citrus restaurant where we had all our meals, they never asked us if we would require a high chair for our infant(8 months old).

The event coordination team and hotel management team ensured every little need was met without any hesitation or concern.

      "I spent 5 days at the Leela on a short trip to India.   Cons: With a raging covid pandemic, the management definitely needs to manage its guests better. My stay coincided with a big fat wedding and it was shocking to see guests scurrying like monkeys all over the property without masks, coughing open mouthed in lifts and over the buffet in the restaurant. In all fairness the hotel staff tried to run and pass masks to them but the management has to grow some teeth and ban entry to guests who refuse to adhere to covid policies at the risk of losing their business.  Pros: The property itself is nice and well maintained. However, what really stands out is the dedication of the staff. In particular Imran at the Concierge who went out of his way to help with arranging my pre-flight \n",

      "I sold Leela Bengaluru to my family for my daughter's first birthday as the place where Deepika held her reception. As we come back from the hotel, it needs no more introduction for any of us. From the room, the food, to the service, there is no match to other so called 5 stars. The fact that this standard of service is achieved in these times makes the feat even more well earned. There were many who deserve mention, Kartik who takes a personal interest while serving the guests at Citrus and  Mr Zafar, the head chef who not only made the cake I requested, he devoted time to discussing it with me. But I would like to say that Ms Farzana deserves the highest regard because she takes the standard of service to an exceptionally high if not unbeatable level. She is an asset to the \n",

We had a smooth checkin and were shown into our room but had some issues with noisy neighbors on the first night which we brought to the hotel managements attention next morning. We received a call from their duty manager Farzana who not only apologized but immediately upgraded us to a huge suite.   The rest of the stay at the hotel just went from good to better with fantastic service starting right from breakfast at Citrus and continued at the all the restaurants like jamavar and zen and the library bar.

      "Had the lovely opportunity to stay at Leela’s Bangalore with my wife for a week . Though a hotel like this doesn’t really need any endorsement, I’d add that despite the fact that they had over 300 rooms and despite the overbearing business and clientele they handled on a daily basis , they made us feel as if we were the only guests there . Right from the entrance , we would be greeted by courteous staff , who, by the end if the stay were like friends.  The rooms and facilities are the best in the business, as usual for Leela, but what really stands out is there personal touch . \n",

      "We’ve gone to The Leela many times, but usually it has been to eat at their fantastic restaurant Le Cirque. This time we did a 2 day staycation, and it was everything we imagined it would be. The suites are fantastic, and I especially loved sitting in the balcony in their garden view rooms.  A special shout out to Farzana and Saikat, who were the duty managers on those days. Once Farzana found out it was our anniversary, she went to great lengths to ensure that we had a fantastic outing. Am already looking forward to the next occasion where I can find an excuse to visit here again. \n",

      "This year is a nightmare after nightmares.. and with so much of anxiety surrounding travel, I settled on a 2020 staycation of a sort which could combine work and pleasure together! Leela palace was perfect for such a retreat. Great food, spacious big rooms and an alert team who could ferry in and out of the room silently; features that made the staycation of a week homely. The customized kids menu was truly a blessing for any stressed out mom. \n",

Farzana called us before we arrived and planned our rooms close to each other and also surprised us with an upgrade . Dinner at the Restraunt Jamavar was super as always. They really have the best lamb dishes. Tried the turmeric cocktail for the first time and loved it.  Breakfast was also great and Nikita made a huge effort to ensure that we had minimal contact with other people in the Restraunt . The Leela is our favourite choice as a family for staycations and we always come back happier and relaxed .

So we decided to be at Leela palace Bangalore for a night stay(club room) to celebrate our special day. At Leela, Abhishek and his entire team made us really feel comfortable with the surroundings and safety protocols. The hygiene standard of room, sanitising kids chair before every use and a set menu to minimise contact are few examples which made us feel relaxed.  The cocktail hours need a special mention.

Unfortunately due to COVID and many travel restrictions our plans failed .. My sister was ok not doing anything but I wanted to give her a surprise as how could I let my sister get married without one . I wanted to give her a luxury vacation and immediately thought of the leela . My husband and I were having lunch at Jamvaar and we went to the front desk on our way out . I met Abhishek there and he said don’t worry ma’am we will make this a truly memorable experience. And they truly did ! From picking us up from our place , to the amazing spa day that was planned it was all done meticulously and with a personal touch . \n",

From the booking process to staying and concluding our stay we were very well taken care of. The property itself is beautiful despite being in the middle of the city. The staff (Harshit and team) were caring, attentive and always pleasant to interact with. Though we stayed only one night my kids were happy enough to say they didn't want to leave the place! All safety precautions were taken by the hotel.Would recommend if you are looking for an oasis within the city. \n",

I would like to specially mention a particular person , Mr. karthick , from the citrus restaurant , his way of treating guests , is something that should be appreciated . He is one of the reason that I'm back to leela in a week's time , at the end of my road trip . I've been to a number of hotels , I generally don't give reviews , but this hotel deserves one ! \n",

The hospitality was like no other. Everything was impeccable, from the room service to the spa services. I remember we got a package so we could get 50% off spa and 20% off room services, but there were extra things we did not know were included. For example, the doorbell rang and they brought us a beautiful bottle of champagne and a cake, both of which were complimentary. Also, I had an appointment in the area and the Leela helped set up transportation so I didn't have to figure out how to get there and back. The food at the Leela is amazing. It's a multi-national cuisine menu done well. So many times \n",

The trasformation has been done with impeccable quality, detailed planning and execution - something that Leela is known for always.  While the ambience and the food are as good as they always were, the most noticeable change is in the care shown by the staff, led by Ms.Farzana. This customer centricity makes a world of difference, and perhaps the much required switch from customer satisfaction to customer delight. Ms. Gauravi and Mr. Deb @ Citrus and Mr. Abhishek @ Jamavar deserve special mention, for treating guests akin to relatives in their homes. Kudos to this wonderful team. \n",

Truly magnificent and indeed a place for relaxation, contemplation and rejuvenation.  Cocktail hours were laid out at the grand yet discreet Library Bar - we chose an outdoor seating since the evening was pleasant and the air crisp.

All the staff are always wearing mask and shield and even the cutlery in the restaurant were provided in sanitized pouches. Overall a wonderful stay.

The genuine warmth and friendliness starts already in the magnificent lobby, with it's resplendent gardens and stunning architecture.  Check-in was extremely swift and efficient and we were escorted to our suite located on the fourth floor overlooking the garden and pool area.

      "Finally made the return trip to the wonderful Leela Palace in Bangalore after years. And what a return it was, decided to book a staycation package for the fam which included a great breakfast, no buffet due to the situation however they did not disappoint with a unlimited a la carte menu and more that was absolutly superb. Next the room which includes an upgrade, was transporting away from the city noise to an oasis of the garden and palace view from the balcony. Very well appointed room with relaxing soaking tub. While I was there for the night I took full advantage of their amazing gym facilities 3 times, it has everything you could ask for and top class equipment standards.

We went for a short break with family & a few friends and had the most enjoyable time! The staff at the Leela are so professional, warm & welcoming- one can opt for a contactless check in if you wish. The rooms are luxurious and spotless- they are sanitized and sealed prior to ones arrival. You will be spoiled with some incredible food- needless to say Chef Zafar and his team delighted us with a beautiful high tea, later some delicious canapés and a fabulous dinner! And breakfast of eggs Benedict and decadent waffles! Ashu you served us so well!

Our stay at the Leela Palace Bengaluru was outstanding the say the least. The hotel had undertaken all the necessary safety precautions to make us feel as comfortable as possible - right from entering the hotel, check-in and taking us to our room. The room itself was lovely and and having a balcony overlooking the beautiful Leela gardens was a huge bonus. We started our day off with a hi-tea at the library bar and then back to our rooms for some much needed R&R.

Even when you get in their BMW X5s, they give you a \"SURAKSHA\" Kit for your safety as said by the title. Not only the safety, but the interiors also were just fabulous! It completely gives you a \"Raja\" kinda feel in their premises. Palace like exteriors and interiors, beautiful sceneries and gardens inside the hotel only! Fantastic food service! The best thing was that they could even customize your food the way you like it which is seen in almost no other hotels! The room service was excellent and all the staff were extremely friendly and very well trained! Good job on that part Leela! It is a must visit if you're on a trip \n",

Other than offering a very competitive rate, they guided us about all recent health advisory requirements before we left UK. During our travel, they kept in touch throughout and received us at the airport at 3AM in the morning.  Keeping in mind our big baggage volume, they organized suitable transportation to hotel at an economic rate. Helped us getting through health check formalities at the airport. The next 15 days, we had excellent room service along with personal touches, wherever required. Someone always checked about our welbeing periodically.  Shifting countries are usually stressful, but thanks to sincere help from Leela Palace, it turned into a pleasant experience. \n",

Clean and modern in the stately style of India. Great restaurant with excellent staff and service, run of the house with little distractions and an excellent bar. My recommendation  is to go and let the culture wash over you. Enjoy the difference and the experience. \n",

      "Being arrested in the house for close to 3 months, I mustered courage to dine at the Leela, after my patience had given up owing to the global pandemic. Hotel looked deserted and very different which is now termed as the 'new normal.' Minimal but experienced team members could be seen taking charge and following all the hygiene protocols. Citrus was operational and we ordered a la carte after technology took over right from order taking as you scan codes to see the menu on your mobile phones including that of final bill. I found this the most comforting. Food as usual was mouth watering. Team members were spot on and looked at absolute ease, wearing those masks, headgears etc. They just won me over and I was in awe on how are they keeping themselves so motivated in these \n",

I worked at a client office inside Leela Palace for a month (yes they have quite a few floors dedicated to office buildings, on one side of the palace).  Everything is scenic, from the open air entrance, the lovely y beside the gardens with a view of small waterfammd, to the restaurant t area among the trees, with a stream  flowing through it.

The room I was allocated was comfortable and the view from the balcony was scenic and green. The parrots and mynas chirping in the morning woke me up every day.  The hotel room had everything and even many surprises like Jacuzzi bath which was not expected in single rooms.  The food was delicious and they even offered south Indian varieties and complimentary fruit salad for every meal.  The service by the staff was par excellence. All the staff members at the hotel took the necessary safety precautions. The hotel was reluctant to provide laundry service and many did not opt for it for obvious reasons. The covid screening was arranged by the hotel for 650Rs. \n",

      "I stayed at the Leela Palace between June 19th and June 26th 2020 for my mandatory institutional quarantine in Bangalore. The room I was allocated was spacious and comfortable - it had everything you could ask for in a hotel room. The food was delicious and filling. There were tea sachets and a kettle in the room - that I used to make my morning and afternoon tea. The service by the staff was par excellence. All the staff members at the hotel took the necessary safety precautions, and there was an obvious emphasis on ensuring that no unnecessary contact was made.  In my experience, the Leela went above and beyond in ensuring I was well taken care of for the entire week I was there. I don’t think there is a better hotel to quarantine at in Bangalore given the quality of service \n",

The various restaurants offer several possibilities, from typical cusine to more standard/Western food, allowing formal dinners as well as more normal meals. The garden is a wonderful place for the breakfast and for some relax, while the small internal mall can give a flavor of Indian shops, with much more qulet but with less color and atmosphere. \n",

Granted and it’s also the most expensive so far, but my husband and I loved it, Like an oasis of peace and luxury in a big noisy city with terrible traffic. \n",

As usual, the quantity of the hotel is top-nouch, cleanliness is unbelievable, and service was fantastic, lots of places to eat, lounge, etc. Business office was great, concierge bent over backwards to help me package a piece of art for a long trip home. Best of all was that the price was cheeper than ever (propably from increased competition in the city). At 4am it took me 45-50 minutes to get to the new airport. Count at about 90 minutes in typical traffic. New airport is great!!! and 1000x better than the old one (that should surely be preserved just to show how far India has come in just a few years). \n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Leela Palace Bangalore, it was really amazing.I'm usually very tough on five star hotels because I usually dont think they live up to their reputation, but this one really did. Everyone talks about the Decor but I want to talk about the service. Here are a few Highlights 1. I told the bellboy that my wife likes the flower we saw in the lobby. when we returned from dinner, someone had filled our room with the same flowers. Needless to say, my wife was pretty impressed. 2. We told the front desk that we are going for a long car trip. They offered us free bottled water, a bottle of sunscreen and asked for our driver's cell phone number so that they could call and check on us in case we got lost.  All in all, I fully agree that The Leela's service is off \n",

      "The level of service at the Leela is off the charts. I've spent four times the room rate in other exclusive resorts and they couldn't match the service here. Every base is covered. I did ante up the extra money for a club level room (5th and 6th floors) which gave me access to a separate restaurant, billiards room, and two club lounges; one of which has complimentary drinks and apettizers throughout the day. Perhaps the stay would have been a little different if I weren't on a club level room.  The entire facility is wall to wall, ceiling to floor, marble; except for the massive columns throughout. The room I was in had  hardwood flooring which was really nice. Each day they refreshed a tray of chocolates (made in the hotel), fruit, and bottled water.   I should also point out \n",

The only thing that you need to do is to make doubly sure that the airport bus leaves you to Leela if you have opted for it. They will try their best to leave you in an inferior hotel.  Advise to Leela : You NEED to have a direct line with BBMP @ Airport and make sure you get the list of your guests prior to the moment they land in the Escorting ride from airport. \n",

The sole reason was that the 5stars are better equipped to handle anything. And it was an absolutely right decision.

The Leela in Bengaluru was also first rate with the exception of the Club lounge. The Club lounge was a complete waste of money and a real con. My advice to you is don't bother paying extra for the Club Lounge. The management of The Leela in Bengaluru should note that Club lounges across the Leela brand should be standardised and that the Leela Club lounge in Delhi is what customers expect - after all that is what they are paying for.  Again, the saving grace were the Staff - they were all first rate - attentive, friendly and engaging.

Not only that the location is great and in proximity to great locations, but the service is excellent. \n",

We stayed for a few days and enjoyed our stay as well.  We left with not only a great experience but lovely memories as well. And I cannot finish my review without mentioning the food on our party day and how amazing it was! I still dream about the panisse, the sanas bowls and the angoori jamun!

      "I stayed at the Leela Palace Bengaluru for a week on business.  I have visited the Leela in Delhi previously and was interested in how this would compare.  I have to say that the hotel was amazing, the staff courteous and friendly, the food and the choice of food was out of this world.  India is a fabulous country but it can be busy!  To have a luxury hotel to retreat to after a long day was really special.  If you are looking for a  location to base yourself out of in Bengaluru it has to be the Leela. \n",

The library bar is classy with great drinks and food. The service is outstanding. Everyone working here is super attentive and ready to help. They went out of their way to contact our car driver and when we could not reach him. They called an Uber for me when my phone would not connect for some reason. Really loved the experience. My only gripe is that some of the rooms are too far from the elevator. There is a second elevator, but it goes down to the 1st floor and you still have to walk quite a bit to the lobby. \n",

It truly feels like you're staying in a palace. The rooms are spacious and spotless. The food is always delicious, even the Western foods are spot on and as close to traditional preparation as possible. The staff is incredible and truly serves from their heart, instead of just considering it their job. The hidden gem is the spa with the underground jacuzzi pool. If you ever get a chance to stay here I promise you will not regret it. \n",

From entering the hotel and being welcomed by Ganesh, his warm smile sets the tone. The front office team, housekeeping, F&B staff, do an incredible job at making you feel at home. Everyone seemed to remember my name as well as our guests from the moment we arrived and every time we walked through the lobby, we were greeted as family.

No doubt by now my default residence in Bengaluru.   Dedicated people here work so hard every day, in the foreground and background, to deliver such an exceptional experience.

From the first \"point of contact\" at the reception to the last point, every member of the staff served us with a \"genuine\" smile, which is rare. The smile is always there in all hotels, but the genuineness of it is rare. The staff exceeded our expectations.

Our 23 mile journey from the airport to the hotel took 50 minutes, though it could be significantly longer at a time of busier traffic. Our room was large and well equipped, with an excellent shower, large bed and separate living room, and plenty of spare electrical sockets for recharging. Certain rooms, including this one, had access to the fifth floor lounge facility,   I measured the WiFi at 25 Mp s download and 26 Mbps upload, so a very good speed, and plenty of bandwidth for watching video as well as more basic web browsing.

The hospitality at Leela Palace is more the what words can describe from the driver, waiter, cleaners, front desk right up to the management who gives you such warm and personalize attention. Every stay at Leela had been simply awesome and I feel right at home.  Recently stay was a personal visit - I had requested a candle light dinner set up at my room balcony, this was a special occasion. The team had put in so much of effort and details in the arrangement that we were blown away speechless and it could not be any better.

      "What does one say about Leela Palace Bengaluru – that is arguably the best hotel in India? But that’s not all. From the supreme grandeur of the hotels’ architecture to its’ brilliantly landscaped and thick foliage surrounds, you walk in to a palace.  One travels through a hotel which has been classically laid out and where the detail in design is impeccable. But of the heart of this palace are its’ people. People who run it with love and devotion. The guest is made to feel like royalty and all their wishes are promptly fulfilled. From the doormen to their lobby managers, guest relation managers, lounge keepers and their restaurant teams, each have a quiet but styled efficiency.

Rooms are the highlight of this hotel - definitely one of the most spacious and well laid out plans out there.   F&B : Good food, but I prefer the ITC any day. Not a big fan either of their Asian restaurant either.  Usually find their Indian restaurant to be very very cold.   Room for Improvement : Front desk staff have to be trained to be more welcoming.

Everyone here knows me by name and I am no more their guest but part of their family.  It's their personal touch and the guest care that places them at the top.

The only complain is about pepper and spice food, since the Leela hosts people from all of the world, on the names of the foods it should mention how spice it is. \n",

      "This is my 2nd stay at the hotel this year. Since the moment I walked in until now, the hospitality shown by the friendly staff cannot be just expressed by words. Come and stay here to experience it on your own.  Angira checked me in. The professionalism she and her team showed me leaves a lasting impression on me. Angira is a truly outstanding person and she truly upheld the hospitality of the Leela chain, Mr Nair.  Farzana’s interaction with the guests has no parallels. Another outstanding leader, Mr Nair.  The restaurant staff are very caring and extremely helpful and friendly. Pranab and Deb are two great examples along with their team, Mr Nair.  The housekeeping staff and the Security personnel were exemplary.  I was inspired by the life of your dad, Mr Nair, when I watched \n",

Apart from its royal decor and ambiance, its facilities include a spa, a pool, three fine restaurants and a staff pre-programmed to welcome, assist and for whom the word 'impossible' doesn't exist. There are also 40 (yes 40) drivers on hand to ferry guests around town (at extra cost) if desired and as Bangalore traffic permits (ie slowly). All in all, and in a highly competitive market, one of Bangalore's premier hotel addresses. Why not the full five stars? Not everything works the way it should: the wardrobe light in my bedroom refused to extinguish itself; the flush in the toilet did not work;  the shaving mirror was poorly illuminated and I missed a switch by the bedside to extinguish all lights.

      "I was staying in this hotel for business purposes. I have stayed in hotels in the US and Europe (both for pleasure and business) and I can truly state, that no hotel was like this.  It starts from the service of smiling employees that truly respect your privacy and attend to every needs or questions. It continues with the breakfast buffet, which was rich and ever changing on a daily basis. The grounds are amazing, everywhere you look, you can see amazing visuals and decor. And finishes with the room. I took the basic room, which already in size and comfort is many levels above compared hotels that I have stayed in.  This will not be my last visit to India and this will most definitely will not be my last visit to Leela Palace.  Had a great time and first impression.  Continue \n",

      "The hotel was a beautiful hidden gem inside a crazy busy city. The loud traffic and busy streets were very stressful while visiting Bengaluru and this hotel was a great escape from that madness. They had a bit too many staff members it seemed as I always had about 10 people saying hello to me from the lobby to my room. This is very kind, but a bit overwhelming. The service in all the restaurants was great. The room was nice, but a bit musty. The hotel had an overwhelming smell of roses or floral perfume pumped in on every floor. It was not nice enough weather to enjoy the pool unfortunately. The Library Lounge was excellent service and beautiful filled with antiques and expensive liquor bottles. Breakfast was absolutely delicious. The Le Cirque Signature restaurant was fabulous \n",

Everyone here is incredibly nice and accommodating, and I’m leaving with a heavy heart knowing I’ll actually miss some of the guys working here. The Citrus breakfast buffet is awesome and Sandeep Verma, the restaurant manager, would say hey every morning and hook me up with special stuff from the cooks. It really felt like I was getting special treatment the entire time, even though I’m just some punk 24 year old showing up in sweats and ratty t-shirt. The Library Bar is also badass with a great atmosphere and charismatic bartenders. The one I bonded with was named Pankaj, and he was great for advice for places to visit around Bangalore.

      "I stayed there for 7 nights, and had breakfast and dinner 6 times each. It was business purpose, but I chose this hotel by myself with their hotel photo. Oh, all the pictures were with Photoshop magic. Well, the real hotel was very nice, but not with the bright color and the light. I like the hotel atmosphere, the building, the garden, breakfast, room, room amenities. However, the staff was not professional. I complained about some problems with managers but they sent me sorry reply a few days later after I checked out. They could've had a chance to apology for small but many mistakes which I felt their service was not professional. The general manager sent me sorry email, and he promised me for better stay in the future. But I think, how could they improve if they don't know \n",

He goes out of his way to say hello and take care of us. I highly recommend both the Leela and Citrus due to the service alone but for so many other reasons as well \n",

The board rooms Were Plush, luxurious yet not remind us of any Boredom. Hosting top quality internet and Technical Support the meetings Are uninterrupted.

The gardens are very beautiful and have been a pleasant surprise considering the location of the hotel. Staff have been so friendly yet very professional. They mentioned the hotel has been there for over 15 years but I guess the maintenance of the place does not give the feel of being that old.

Few dishes which stood out. -  1. Onion Chutney ( Prabhu the chef needs appreciation). 2. The Small Onion Sambar ( 25th Aug Sunday ) was superb too. Took us back to our hometown taste. 3. The French Toasts were superb.  Also do note that Karthik Das made us feel at ease & at home serving us some of the best Filter Coffees & Masala Dosas, special marks on this. Mauli Banker also suggested us some of the best Kheema Parottas and Indonesian style omlettes. Both of them served with a smile and big heart. Staffs like them are a treasure to Leela & hope this message reaches their peers.   Much regards, Ram \n",

We stayed at presumably top hotels in every location(we’d been saving up for this trip since a long time ;)). Leela Bangalore was by far the best place that we stayed in. Everything about it was exemplary - from rooms, to hospitality, to food. And I must mention the fact that Le Cirque Signature serves the best Italian food ever! It was certainly a larger than life experience.  Highly recommended. \n",

Left my iPad charging in my room and when I returned from a business meeting my iPad was cleaned, 100% charged and the cable neatly wound next to it. The attention to detail just makes your stay that extra special.   Spoilt for choice with bars and restaurants serving delicious food.

In fact the experience was better.  The reason behind are two young ladies who raised the service level bar higher than expected.  Ms. Farzana and Ms. Suprita, were two young energetic and genuinely helpful lobby managers.  They took time to make my wife's and my stay even better.  They interacted with us genuinely and gave us quite a few suggestions to make our stay in Bengaluru much better.

Apparently the hotel is modelled after a nearby palace, and it shows! Amazing architecture.   The menu offered western, Indian and pan-asian options. Being my first time in India, I asked my server for his recommendation, a lovely shrimp dish and crab cake for appetizers, and a spicy (western spicy ;) fish curry for dinner.   Food was excellent but I was particularly pleased with the excellent service. (Londoners need to up their game!) Parnab D. really set the bar for friendly service without being overbearing.

The staff is very warm and are always willing to help you and make your stay memorable. The food is to die for especially the morning breakfast and their dim sum brunch. Next time you visit bangalore make sure you stay at this hotel. \n",

      "My Girlfriend's birthday was the occasion and I wanted to surprise her, was recommended  by my best friend about the leela palace bangalore. Was hesitant  intitially considering  the place being in south India.when I reached  the place , weather is awesome and was as much surprised as my girlfriend. It fell like we are king and queen of a palace. Best place to relax. Be it the pool , the lawn and center garden .never had to go out of the hotel. The stay was comfortable , awesome food , nice spa. Had loads of fun and has been my best vacation  so far!!!!!! As king and queen...... \n",

      "Our 1st visit to Banglore and impressed by the security set up at all Leela hotels we stayed at around cultural triangle. I won’t repeat many of the good comments of others - photos also speak for themselves. A beautiful luxury/palace hotel with filtered air and water on tap...a peaceful sanctuary from both the intense traffic and smog of banglore - a fascinating city but pollution and divide between rich and poor shocks even those who’ve traveled widely through Asia, Sth America etc. We hope Leela hotels contribute to greater opportunities for the less fortunate? There are many incredible, historic sites just minutes from this hotel another stunning Leela hotel. We particularly loved the Asian restaurant zen at this hotel - great chef! Thanks to all the friendly staff. \n",

      "The correct word to describe the hotel is palace hotel.  It’s is so beautiful and green. I stayed there with my husband for holiday during our anniversary. It was a surprise, I was totally awestruck. Service was so good and people are so friendly and caring. They took care of our preferences. Very good trained staff, Kartik ishita are names I remember.  Food we had at all their restaurants apart from their bar I guess, very good food. Thanks to chefs. Breakfast spread was also good here. I saw a lot of crowd everyday when I was for breakfast there. Trust me once you are inside the hotel you don’t need to step out. Though we went to see some breweries around too.  Thanks a lot for making our anniversary special. \n",

It was my first time over there and I felt like a king, to be honest.

From the time I arrived, to the check-in process (must say was a very smooth and effortless process), the 3 days that I stayed until check-out, it was one of the memorable moments I have experienced at a hotel. The employees are not only well-trained but friendly and very informative too. Will recommend The Leelas to all my friends and family. \n",

The breakfast buffet was incredible, all the food that you could imagine is there.  Really good restaurants inside the hotel with Asian food or french - Italian. Prices are medium-high. Wine is expensive at the hotel.  Facilities include gym, spa, swimming pool and shopping mall. \n",

Beyond being recognized was happy with the fact that my suggestion was taken well and changes done accordingly. During my last visit had made a suggestion about the menu at Citrus, to my luck happened to stay in the hotel on the day their new menu was launched. The new menu had my suggestions implemented and has a great selection to choose from. I believe this is what sets the Leela Palace apart from most other places in the city. Comfortable rooms, great food and most imortantly friendly staff, guess thats the best part about The Leela Palace \n",

The breakfast spread is just out of the world and will suit every palate. \n",

      "The hotel is unlike any business hotel in the city. Very palatial look and feel. As soon as you enter the view is so green and breathtaking.  The services are off the charts . I stayed in their deluxe room which was so full of luxury from the bed to amenities to services by housekeeping department.  I had breakfast everyday at their coffee shop CITRUS and the spread of the food is very lavish including both Indian continental food items.  We had a team dinner at their Asian restaurant Zen and trust me that the food their nothing like I had in recent past. It was so tasty. Services were impeccable. 5 stars to the team leela Bangalore. Great job done. I will always refer this hotel to anyone who is traveling to Bangalore and I wish to stay here again in future. Thanks \n",

      "This is an excellent hotel with amazing facilities, we had a 2 night stay, the rooms were large and well maintained / equipped.  For dinner we ate at the main restaurant Citrus which was very good the selection was from Italian, French and Asian cuisine.  After dinner we had a drink in the bar, another great experience and the staff were very experienced and customer focused however the price was very high and surprising €120 for 3 Gin and tonics. \n",

I can highly recommend their restaurants for dinner. \n",

      "A very comfortable stay in the midst of a busy city. Had been to Bangalore for a family get together and was recommended to stay at the Leela Palace by a colleague, who frequents to Bangalore on business trips. I was with family though but this place was perfect for families as well. Even though the place was more or less occupied by many for a wedding, was surprised that we were treated so well, being recognized every where and all my family requests for specific food preparations, spa treatments, travel arrangements were very well taken care off. From Jayant in the front desk to Meer at the breakfast station to Anagha in the room keeping everybody were so kind and helpful. Have to make a special mention of Chef Rijesh who made sure to meet us everyday for breakfast and happily \n",

      "Leela brings to the forth excessive opulence with the humility of that feeling of being at home.  The warmth received from start to finish.  The quality of the food at Jamavar is amazing and the chefs are willing to go the extra mile to ensure that you eat what your heart desires.  Special mention to the Lounge on the 5th, a special feeling for the special guest.    The following staff made our lives even more special and must be commended:  1.  Supritha and Homlal -- At the door entrance 2.  Promod --  Citrus cafe for morning breakfast 3.  Jacqueline - 5th Floor royal lounge 4.  Monti -- Italian fine dining and 5th floor lounge  Well done to Prathik and his team for ensuring we come back to Bangalore!!! \n",

A true palace in every sense,  being treated like royalty,  the location gives opportunities  to get some of the best portraits done,  provided you have a good photographer,  which again the hotel was more than happy to refer to.

The breakfast is the highlight of this beautiful hotel.  The rooms have a magical view of the gardens below and doesn't feel that you are in  the middle of the city.  The hotel is centrally located and is very close to top shopping places of the city.

The Leela rep greeted me with the paperwork already filled out and assured me that they would arrange getting my luggage taken care of.

That was the first time I had the impression that the hotel furnishings were getting long in the tooth. Maybe I was staying in an older wing this time. My room was a very long walk from the main elevators. \n",

It was my first stay and second visit after 3.5 years when just visited it to have dinner in their Pan Asian restaurant.  The room was spick and span clean and comfortable and the bathroom was fabulous. The food in their Indian and Pan Asian restaurants were outstanding and delicious.

There are several nice restaurants in the hotel. The pool was large with many chairs and towels. I had the pool to myself every time I used it. There is also an awesome yoga studio near the pool where you can take a class from an amazing yoga instructor each morning. The best part of the stay was the amazing staff!

A health club with gym, steam sauna steam bath and Jacuzzi pool. I got a massage in the spa and it was excellent. They provide water, lockers, towels and robes in the spa. The concierge was very helpful, obtaining items we needed and advising and helping arrange a weekend day trip. Probably the only improvement could have been better soundproofing between the rooms.

It takes a special kind of culture to build that into a team.   Dinner at zen was fabulous. Sitting outside one has to deal with mosquitoes though. Sake. Dim sum. Sushi platter and a yummy egg fried rice were all too class. A flat bira blond was quickly replaced. All in all a good evening.   Breakfast on day one was at the main dining area.

Hospitality was absolutely second to none, the staffs attentiveness was astounding. The best compliment I can give is they made me feel like I was at home.   There are two many staff members to even begin to thank but but not one single staff member dissapointed! A special mention to the general manager Pratik who made sure my stay was comfortable   The food was of a high quality standard and I eat at the citrus restaurant most nights ... the steak was delicious!

The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and you can really just relax.  Speaking of relaxing I highly recommend the Spa.  Even if you just use the Jacuzzi and the sauna it's worth it but the massage is \n",

      "I stayed here for a solo trip in the  month of December-2018.   Experience 1: I traveled to Bangalore from Canada and was jet lagged. I was sleeping and to my mistake i forgot to put the room in Do Not Disturb. I get knocked by a staff whose job was to check my consumption of things which they have stocked in their refrigerator. The guy knocked and I said later. The person was hell bent on checking and I opened the door. Is there a thing called privacy in the room in here?   Experience 2: About couple of hours from experience 1 above. I get knocked by the room service. I politely said, I dont want room service. The staff reply - 'Please open the door'. I have never been treated so badly by any hotel across the world. The room service wanted to enter the room on any conditions. \n",

Dining - on the whole, excellent.

Unsure if this is how they treat all their guests, but I felt that the staff were particularly attentive because I was on my own. They were there when I needed them but unobtrusive when doing my own thing.   What makes the Leela stand out from other hotels is that it is built in the architectural style of the Royal Palace of Mysore and has lush gardens, a lagoon and very impressive amenities. Very unusual to have such a large palace style building and extensive grounds and gardens in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a city.    The rooms were \n",

Overall the hotel maintains a high standard of everything, but the best about it is the customer service and the team. Simply the best I've had so much in my experience. Have never seen so much focus on the small details that make huge impression. Usually I was reading the newspaper during breakfast, one morning I've forgotten to take it. By the time I was picking up my food from the buffet, someone has placed the newspaper on my table. A very nice personal touch that makes you feel valued. \n",

      "Then the Leela Palace is made for you. The gigantic new palace filled with elephants sculptures, marbles, flowers, and uptight staff feels more like staying at an airport or a mall than at a hotel. Absolutely zero charm. Arcades of shops augment the feel of a commercial mall. It's an absolute maze of entrance doors and elevators, you need a guide to get you to the front desk. The pool is nice but so large that the water is always cold. The Citrus restaurant is quite pleasant, with good food, but again suffers from a lack of warmth from the staff. Overall, for the huge cost of the rooms (starting at 18,000 rupees per night), I prefer to stay some other place. \n",

      "The Leela Palace in Bangalore is truly an amazing property. the entrance, gardens, pool and rooms are so beautiful - we often find yourself just frozen, looking around and smiling.  The service during our stay was impeccable, and so was the post stay service. I needed some assistance with my invoice, and Mr. Abhishek was incredibly helpful and kind.  At the end of the day, the service is what makes or breaks a hotel and the service here was amazing. Highly recommended. \n",

      "I stayed at this beautiful hotel for a night. It is not less then a palace, very good  greenery. Staff is very good.  I highly  recommend  Leela Palace Bangalore. From restaurant to room everything was above our expectations \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely a good hotel, if not really at the top. Interesting mix of architecture, decor, friendly service and reasonably good food. Service failure happened a few times and some of the waiting was not quite as professional as it could be. More than anything the service was inconsistent, varying from really good to substandard. They have not beaten the ever-present road noise but it's not bad. Toiletries are good quality and facilities newish and clean. Reasonable selection of restaurants and tastes. rooms spacious and well appointed. Free internet is excellent \n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed at the Leela 5+ times in the last 2-3 years, and it's always been a good experience.  The rooms and the public areas are spacious, the restaurants (especially Zen and Jamavar) have great food (and cocktails!), the pool area is lovely (and under-used, i.e. quiet).  The service is also fantastic - and during my last visit the Leela staff were very helpful in connecting me with a local tailor.  Highly recommended. \n",

      "Was visiting Bangalore for a business trip and stayed at iconic Leela , I must say it was the best experience of my life and when I say it means something as I travel a lot across the world for business   Opulent lobby with antique art collection tion all across the hotel , food is mind boggling and ever so helpful team here makes the stay worth a visit every time   Everyone I came across during my stay were present with smile on their face and always ready to help   Rooms are spacious and with balconies complimenting the beautiful weather of Bangalore   I am completely satisfied with my stay and for sure bring my family on my next visit   Look forward to come back soon and still then keep up the amazing work \n",

Room service was unparallelled. Praveen at Citrus breakfast restaurant took personal care of us .  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The gardens are luscious as well & good for a morning or evening leisurely walk. The only downside is that it is a huge hotel & our room was quite a distance away. \n",

Rava fried fish, Mutton Rogan Josh, Baked yogurt with Blueberry compote, the perfect Mojitos, the Chicken Mulligatawny soup, the Lamb Seekh Kebabs, everything were just perfect.

It is beautifully maintained and just mesmerizing to stay in at least once to experience it - to wake up to see the sun rising over Bangalore from your balcony, overlooking the palace and gardens below. I could have never left the balcony. Pool was very cold when I was there - temperature control might be good for the cooler months. Took a walk around the gardens and you can spend ages taking photos there and amongst the hotel grounds. Restaurants seem lovely and seem to have great ambiance too, although I did not get a chance to try any of them out, outside of Citrus for breakfast each morning. Breakfast was also amazing. However, for a five-star hotel, I felt the service, efficiency, \n",

We stayed on the Club floor and found all staff to be keen, enthusiastic and eager to please. A big thank you to Jermol, Dinesh, Debtanu and not forgetting Abishek who helped us with our late check request, on the front desk.

During a ten day stay we couldn't find anything to fault the Leela Palace.  A little disappointed with the size of our balcony when we checked in, we were moved swiftly to a perfect room with a secluded balcony. The 4 restaurants meant a wide choice - the food in the Italian/French restaurant never disappointed and there was a wide range of choices to suit every taste in the Indian option. The Citrus restaurant, which also served breakfast, never disappointed.  A most enjoyable stay and we hope to return - to try other Leela hotels.. \n",

We have travelled extensively and do no give praise lightly but credit where credit is due, The Leela Palace must be up there with one of the best hotels that we have ever stayed in.

They have the Indian restaurant, Thai/Asian, Le cirque and the international cuisine. Champagne Sunday brunch is highly recommended. You can drink all the champagne you want!

It's been a while since I visited so I have forgotten quite a few names but will mention the ones I do remember.

This was our first stay at Leela Bengaluru , and we were very skeptical about staying here as it is one of the oldest hotel of their group of hotels if I am not wrong.. Every time I had to decide a hotel in Bengaluru I finally end up in ITC Gardenia for several of my trips to Bangalore , which I always feel luxurious but this time for a change we really wanted to try Leela and we went there with no expectations...  As soon as we entered the hotel we were surprised to see the massive entrance with atleast 20 plus staffs outside waiting for to grab our things \n",

      "This hotel is an oasis right in the middle of Bangalore. Staff is very friendly, rooms are comfy and clean. You always feel very safe. The Le Cirque Italian restaurant is one of the best Italian restaurants I've eaten at in the world.  The grounds are immaculately kept. Overall a beautiful place that I would highly recommend to anyone coming here. \n",

Stunning views of the nature, a great location plus the  faultless service , housekeeping , cuisine , impeccable hygiene make it an absolute delight in every which way.

      "When you pay $200 for a hotel in India, it had better be darn good. The Leela Palace in Bangalore is probably one of India's finest properties; on a very busy thoroughfare and yet green and serene inside, with a minimum of the street & traffic noise bothering you. The room is excellent, and very spacious. I was in 619, the top floor, which is close to the left as I prefer.  Good parts - excellently appointed large rooms. Lots of natural light. Bed quality & comfort. The coffee shop buffet seemed really nice, as was the a-la carte food we ordered.  Look out for however, the little details. - The plug sockets in the outdoor area in the coffee shop, I think are Austrtalian standard. So no indian customer can use those. Which is strange because they said Indians were predominant \n",

Hotel offers luxury marble room, outdoor swimming pool, gym, massage and spa, several restaurant, small garden to walk in. Room service is good.

I prefer more modern hotel but this is a matter of taste I guess. \n",

From the Caribbean to the Far East and from America to Africa and Australia, but I have never stayed anywhere that got it as right as this place. The rooms, the food, the spa, the grounds, the pools... all fantastic. But what makes this hotel so much better is the service. Genuine smiles on everyone - not for the Indians that infuriatingly false 'Have A Nice Day' veneer of what passes for American service these days, no, these people smile like they mean it and when you say thank you they are happy that they have helped and are not simply waiting for the next tip. No bowing and scraping, just people doing what they have been trained to do. A beautiful, beautiful experience. \n",

As for the room itself, it was beautiful -- spacious and comfortable. Plenty of bottled water, a nice sitting area, great water pressure in the shower. We ate at both Citrus and Jamavar -- excellent food and service, no issues. The staff were more than accommodating to my daughter (who likes no spice) and my husband (who prefers extra spice).

The property is lush and beautiful, the rooms (including bathrooms) spacious and well appointed, and the breakfast buffet varied and delicious. But the welcoming, highly attentive staff is what really sets the Leela apart. Within a couple days, it seems like the entire client-facing staff knew the names of our two young children (ages 6 & 7). The kids felt so comfortable at this place that they asked to go \"exploring\" around on their own and they would report back on all the \"friends\" they made at the various venues within the hotels.

My experience  here has been the best so far in the city,  whether it is comfort of the large spacious room or the facilities at the gym and spa or the swimming pool,  staff in all these places have been very hospitable  and so is the facilities.  Highlight of the place though is the amazing food,  though a bit expensive  is worth every penny. Chef Sahadevan made my dining experience  special by giving some of the most authentic  home style prepations from Kerala which makes me want for more.

      "My visit to the Leela palace Bangalore was one I will remember for a very long time. The flamboyance of the place leaves every guest in a state of magic. Their persistence to top the hospitality standards is just impeccable and hence ensured a flawless stay for me. The best part of the visit for me was their gastronomic delicacies across their restaurants. Amongst all,my personal favourite was their all day dining restaurant, Citrus. Each meal left in a big fix to pick from their endless buffet spread. I would struggle to walk out half heartedly after each meal because I wouldn't be able to go through the entire spread. The personal attention that the chefs give at the restaurant is second to none and will for sure leave every guest flabbergasted. I personally was surprised when \n",

      "This hotel only 9 years old. Its not a colonial era hotel but it has the character and ambience of one. My previous post on this hotel would lead one to believe it was built pre-1940. In my second review, it remains an excellent hotel! \n",

      "My stay at the Leela Palace Bangalore has by far been the best so far compared to all hotel stays so far. Had felt very important, when met by the General Manager of the hotel Mr Kunal , who came over to my table to say hello and  enquired about my stay in the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and staff very hospitable and my 4 yr old daughter was welcomed into the room with decorated well presented cookies which she loved. All requests made by my family were promptly acknowledged and more suggestions offered. From the doorman at the entrance to the person who helped me with my luggage as I was checking out, everybody in the hotel we're very friendly and helpful making us feel at home. Food has always been great in this place and we're met time and again to check on our \n",

      "The Leela Palace Bangalore needs no introduction when it comes to grandeur, sheer class and hospitality. Their restaurants namely Citrus, Zen, Jamavar to name a few are rightly rated as few of the best in the city if not the best. Their kitchen boasts of some of the best talent in the country and their executive chef, Mir Zafar Ali (who recently was national awarded as the Best Executive Chef ) manages and crafts the cuisine so passionately with exuberance. This is a noteworthy feature that will pull you back to the same restaurant to dine again. Their cuisine and the spread for a Sunday brunch is vast and very classy. A must visit for its palatial interiors and lovely food. \n",

      "I could not believe when they told me this hotel is over 15 years old,  The place as the name suggests is a palace but interiors and facilities of the hotel are up to date and well maintained. In the hustle bustle of the City life,  a perfect palace where guests are treated like Royalty. Rooms and facilities have a complete Indian touch. The breakfast at citrus was the highlight though, huge spread with varieties in each station. From pancakes to the Indian version of it, everything made to preference and two chefs who made my day were Basha and Giri as they probably do not know to say NO for anything. Asked for best of mangoes and guess what they had some packed for me. Tried to make my egg orders complicated, but they were bang on and perfectly cooked.  Had the opportunity to \n",

The grand ball room is luxurious in the true sense with crystal chandeliers and top class service for each of the hi tea we were given exclusive setups and concepts, There were also a number of breakout sessions which were fun filled & a culinary delight.  The teppenyaki chef was great fun & kept us entertained during Dinner.  The Citrus buffet for breakfast includes a vast varieties of delicacy from around the world.
